                            Seva Samarpan was born from a simple belief: every child deserves access to quality education,
                            and every elder deserves dignity and care in their golden years. Founded in 2014 in the
                            serene hills of Mulshi, Pune, we started with a small study room and a dream to make a
                            difference.

                        <p>
                            Our journey began when we witnessed the struggles of tribal and underprivileged children
                            in rural Mulshi who had to travel long distances for education or lacked proper study
                            facilities. Many talented students were unable to continue their education due to financial
                            constraints and lack of resources.
                        </p>

                            Today, Seva Samarpan stands as a beacon of hope, providing free study space, a comprehensive
                            library with over 1,500 books, and direct education sponsorship to students. We&apos;ve also
                            extended our compassion to create a warm, dignified home for elders in our community.
